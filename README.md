## Creating a Kanban Board Task Management Application - README

Introduction
This project aims to develop a Kanban board-inspired task management application that allows users to manage tasks through different stages of completion. Users can easily organize their tasks into three status groups: To Do, Doing, and Done. This README file provides an overview of the project's front-end and back-end requirements.

Front-end Requirements
1. Homepage
Display all tasks, categorized by their status groups: To Do, Doing, Done.
2. Task Card
Show task titles and descriptions.
3. Add Task
Integrate a form to create a new task.
Prompt users for the title and description of the task.
4. Edit Task
Provide an option to edit an existing task's title and description.
5. Delete Task
Implement a feature to permanently remove a task.
6. Task Status
Allow users to easily drag and drop tasks between the To Do, Doing, and Done categories.
7. Responsive Design
Ensure the application is fully functional and visually coherent on mobile devices.
Back-end Requirements
1. API Endpoints
Create API endpoints to support CRUD operations for tasks.
2. Database Storage
Store tasks in a database to enable data persistence.
Technologies Used
Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React (or any preferred framework), and a drag-and-drop library like React DnD for task management.
Back-end: Node.js (or any preferred backend framework), Express.js for building RESTful API endpoints, and a database system (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or MySQL) for storing task data.
Installation and Setup
Clone this repository to your local machine.

Install the necessary dependencies for both the front-end and back-end:

Front-end: Navigate to the front-end directory and run npm install or yarn install to install the required packages.
Back-end: Navigate to the back-end directory and run npm install or yarn install to install the required packages.
Set up the database:

Configure your database connection details in the back-end application.
Create the necessary database schema and tables if required.
Start the front-end and back-end servers:

Front-end: Run npm start or yarn start to start the development server for the front-end application.
Back-end: Run npm start or yarn start to start the back-end server.
Access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:3000 for the front-end and the specified port for the back-end.
